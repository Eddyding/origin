The Origin libraries are a collection of libraries written using the
latest features of the C++ programming language. They are designed
to wrap the C++ standard library and provide replacements for older
features and new experimental features. The goal of this work is
to foster experimentation in library design and to serve as a data
point for the standardization efforts within C++.

Currently, this site serves two primary purposes: to document the 
evolution and usage of concepts, as documented in the ISO Concepts TS, 
and to provide a basic set of facilities based on that language feature.

Work is currently focused on the use of concepts to specify and 
implement a new version of the C++ standard library. Note that this 
work is independent of the ISO Ranges TS (STLv2), although many ideas 
overlap. Because the Origin libraries are experimental, certain
facilities may be quite different than those proposed for the C++
standard (generally simpler).
