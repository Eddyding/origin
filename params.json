{"name":"Origin","tagline":"Experiments in C++ Library Design","body":"Origin\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe Origin Libraries are collection of libraries written using the\r\nlatest features of the C++ Programming Language. They are designed\r\nto wrap the C++ Standard Library and provide replacements for older\r\nfeatures and new experimental features. The goal of this work is\r\nto foster experimentation in library design and to served as a data\r\npoint for the standardization efforts within C++.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this site serves two primary purposes: to document the \r\nevolution and usage of concepts, as documented in the ISO Concepts TS, \r\nand to provide a basic set of facilities based on that language feature.\r\n\r\nWorks is currently focused on the use of concepts to specify and \r\nimplement a new version of the C++ Standard Library. Note that this \r\nwork is independent of the ISO Ranges TS (STLv2), although many ideas \r\noverlap. Because the Origin Libraries are experimental, certain\r\nfacilities may be quite different than those proposed for the C++\r\nstandard (generally simpler).\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe Origin Libraries have only one dependence: a compiler that implements\r\nthe Concepts TS. Currently, only one compiler does this: GCC. And it must\r\nbe compiled from SVN.\r\n\r\n### Installing GCC\r\n\r\n### Installing Origin\r\n\r\n### Linking against Origin\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n------\r\nThe following people have been active in the design and implementation\r\nof C++ concepts, their implementation in GCC, and the design and\r\n\r\n- Andrew Sutton\r\n- Gabriel Dos Reis\r\n- Bjarne Stroustrup\r\n- Braden Obrzut\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
